# Disclamer #

This is a POC was part of my final degree project. It was done few years ago, so the code is not the best code in the world due to the lack of time and some inexperience with Python in those years.

## Other information: ##

It is part of my final degree practice so the coding style it is not the best due to deadlines.

### Requeriments: ###

* Python 2.7
* Flask
* Sqlite3 Python * 

## TODO: ##

* - Parse "new" Firefox Cache format
* - Firefox Timeline
* - Generate stadistics (graphics,...)
* - Refactor general code quality :D
